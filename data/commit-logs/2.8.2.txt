 Changes in 2.8.1
 ================
-- Fixed to handle JDK 8u60 [#288, #291]

 Changes in 2.8.0
 ================
 
-Enhancements since 2.7
-----------------------
-- Encode properties files using unicode escapes [#228]
-  The properties files are supposed to be loaded using ISO 8859-1 but Android seems to have issues with that.
-  Re-encode the files using unicode escapes to sidestep the issue.
-
-- Avoid ProGuard errors in Android jar [#246]
-  Separate logging from time-zone compilation
-
-
-Compatibility with 2.7
-----------------------
-Build system - Yes
-
-Binary compatible - Yes
-
-Source compatible - Yes
-
-Serialization compatible - Yes
-
-Data compatible - Yes
- - DateTimeZone data updated to version 2015d
- - In the past year, the IANA time-zone database maintainer has changed unique time-zone data for many parts
-   of the world into shared "links". For example, in IANA 'Asia/Kuwait' now links to 'Asia/Riyadh'.
-   (I personally disagree with the IANA time-zone database maintainer's actions but my objections were ignored).
-   This was a problem for Joda-Time as we interpreted the concept of links (many years ago) as only being used
-   for backwards compatibility. Links are exposed in Joda-Time, because if you request a time-zone for a linked
-   identifier you get the target of the link back. As such, in recent versions of Joda-Time, it was not possible
-   to obtain a DateTimeZone with an appropriate identifier for many parts of the world, such as 'Asia/Kuwait'.
-   With this release, most links in the main IANA files are now restored to be real zones.
-   As a side effect of this, some identifiers that used to act as links are now real zones.
-   In summary, in the last Joda-Time release, requesting 'Asia/Kuwait' would have given back 'Asia/Riyadh',
-   but it now returns 'Asia/Kuwait' (where 'Asia/Kuwait' and 'Asia/Riyadh' have the same time-zone rules).
-   In most cases, this won't have any impact on your application.
- Zones affected (now real zones rather than incorrect links):

-Bug fixes since 2.7
--------------------
-- Fix MonthDay.plusDays() [#227]
-  The algorithm was incorrect when adding enough days to cause the month to change twice.
-
-- Fix DateTime.withDate() DateTime.withTime() [#233]
-  The algorithm incorrectly changed the hour of day when certain DST dates were hit.
-  The new algorithm avoids an IllegalInstantException when moving to a DST gap.
-
-- Fix Period.parse() [#238]
-  Negative periods of a fraction of a second were not parsed correctly.
-
-- Format Etc/GMT time-zone using GMT data [#244]
-  This change will provide better text formats for pattern letter 'z'.
-
-- Fix Property.toInterval() [#262]
-  The conversion of a field property to an interval did not take the chronology into account.
-  Thus, dateTime.hourOfDay().toInterval() previously resulted in an interval in the default
-  chronology, rather than the chronology of the dateTime.
-  The chronology is now passed to the interval.

 Joda-Time uses annotations from Joda-Convert.
 In the Java programming language, this dependency is optional, however in Scala it is not.
 Scala users must manually add the Joda-Convert v1.2 dependency.
